 TODO: Setup both reading and writing a log with a logging class (Must attempt to read data from a generated data file for stored control data for a player at startup and must overwrite any stored data when performing a new test for control data)
 TODO: Initalize Logging class globally for data reading/writing on progam start and control test completion
 TODO: Create Testing Structure for both Control and Interference and normalize so crits do not matter (Make sure players don't use bleed as it is luck based [in an uncontrollable way] and thus interfers with testing)
