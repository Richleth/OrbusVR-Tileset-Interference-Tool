TODO: Create Outline for GUI Main Class (Main GUI Class has GUI Elements in it so all GUI Elements are controlled by one object and we can call functions on the object rather than looping through an array in the draw)
 TODO: Create Outline for GUI Element Class
 TODO: Create Outline for Observer Pattern for GUI Element Class
 TODO: Setup both reading and writing a log with a logging class (Must attempt to read data from a generated data file for stored control data for a player at startup and must overwrite any stored data when performing a new test for control data)
 
 TODO: Create classes from above outlines
 TODO: Initalize 1 GUI Main Element globally with a constructor that takes an array of GUI Elements
 TODO: Initalize Logging class globally for data reading/writing on progam start and control test completion
 TODO: Create Testing Structure for both Control and Interference and normalize so crits do not matter (Make sure players don't use bleed as it is luck based [in an uncontrollable way] and thus interfers with testing)
